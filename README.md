# One-Key-L2TP-IKEV2-Setup

## Change logs

20220530: Change to strongswan 5.9.5 and support ubuntu server 22.04 LTS

## Original notes

Only tested on Digital Ocean **Debian** 7 x64/x32 and Debian 8 x64.
Well I guess it would work on Ubuntu, LOL.

The l2tp VPN supports IKEv1, IKEv2, etc.

So iOS, Mac OS, Windows and Android are all supported, esp the 1% Windows Phone users :)

About how to use it, please check the [ref3] part 4.
